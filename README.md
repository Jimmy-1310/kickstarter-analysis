### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to determine any posible trend that determines if a kickstarter project is successfull. Based on the analysis made, we should be able to determine an optimal goal and time of release, for the kickstarter campaign to suceed.

## Analysis and Challenges
After breaking up the data we have come up with 2 different analysis, comparing the outcome with their launch date or their project goal. In order to make any trend clearer to the human eye, graphs have been created to show the data in a visual matter.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

- Comments: The graph demonstrates a clear uprising in succesfull projects between the months of may and june. After this, the ammount of succesfull theater projects keep falling until they are equal to ammount of projects canceled in the month of december. For failed and canceled projects, the ammount stays regularly the same. Although there is a small spike in canceled projects in the month of octobre, but nothing to shocking as the spike the successful project shows in may.
 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

- Comments: Between the ammounts of less than 1000 and 25,000 to 29,999, the Percentage of succesfull projects has a clear negative correlation. On the other hand, the percentage of failed projects has a clear possitive correlation between the same ammounts. After this, the data behaves differently. We can attribute this to the low ammount of projects between the ranges of 35,000 to 39,999 and grater than 50,000.
